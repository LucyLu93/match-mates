# Lucy's MVP (PT20) 'Match Mates'

#### My idea is a sports/fitness app that allows you to connect with people in your area to meet up for games.

#### I will be using 2 API's from Fitbit to access the heart rate monitor on the players watch, as well as their cardiovascular fitness level. These stats will appear on the profile page as well as their picture, name, age and postcode. Each player will also state when their availabilty to play is.

## MySQL, UserFlow && SiteMap
###### I will include two tables in mySQL database, one with the users basic info and some stats and the other for recording their matches with whether they accept or decline. This information will be seen in the 'matches' section of their profile along with pending invites.

###### Below is a UserFlow diagram of the app starting with registration and ending with access to all three parts of the website.

## API Routes
Information pending as authorization is required

## Future features
1. Ideally I would like to include another API from google maps, to allow a more specific location reading for each user.

2. I would also like to include an interactive calender for the profile page, whereby users can mark off their availabilty. When other users request a match with another player, instead of manually typing in their preferred date and time, they can refer to the calender instead and choose accordingly.
